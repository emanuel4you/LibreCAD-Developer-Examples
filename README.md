[LibreCAD](https://www.librecad.org) is a 2D CAD drawing tool
based on the community edition of [QCAD](https://www.qcad.org).
LibreCAD uses the cross-platform framework [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/),
which means it works with most operating systems.
The user interface is translated in over 30 languages.  https://translate.librecad.org
